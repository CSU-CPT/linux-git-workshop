# Introduction

This book is written for less experienced Computer Science students who are interested in learning more about tools that are commonly used in the industry. And, among those commonly used tools, two stand out because of the sheer scale of their adoption: Linux and git.

Because of their adoption, essentially ever developer (unless they are working on a legacy code base) will use these technologies on a daily basis. For this reason, and because knowledge of Linux is required for upper level classes at the Washkewicz College of Engineering at CSU (like C Programming and Operating Systems), the [Computer Peer Teachers (CPTs)](https://engineering.csuohio.edu/advising/computer-peer-teachers-cpts) have decided to offer a short introductory workshop on both of these topics. This is the accompanying book for that workshop.

A link for the recorded portion of the workshop will be provided soon.
